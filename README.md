# Ticket-Trivia
Visitors to museums often encounter several challenges when using manual ticket booking systems, leading to inefficiencies, long wait times, and inconvenience. The manual process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and does not offer a seamless user experience. This results in frustration, especially during peak hours or for tourists unfamiliar with local procedures. Moreover, the lack of a streamlined system prevents the museum from efficiently managing visitor flow, capacity, and revenue tracking.
Need of Ticket Trivia:-
•	An online ticketing system automates the process, significantly reducing time spent waiting in line and enhancing the overall visitor experience.
•	Scalability and Flexibility
•	Visitors might arrive at the museum only to find tickets sold out, causing inconvenience and wasted time.
•	Museums have little access to detailed data regarding visitor behavior, which limits their ability to improve services or plan for future exhibitions.
•	With events like the COVID-19 pandemic, manual ticketing systems are poorly suited to adapting to health regulations, such as limiting the number of visitors or maintaining social distancing.
